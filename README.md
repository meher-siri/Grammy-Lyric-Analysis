## Grammy-Lyric-Analysis

A well written song can take you on a little journey, reminding you of a different time, showing you places you’ve never been, making you feel emotions that are not even your own. But more importantly, a well written song can win Song of The Year at the Grammys, propelling the writers on their very own little journey of fame and fortune - just ask Billie Eilish and Finneas who, earlier this week, won the award for a second time at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. 

Music is a reflection of the times we live in. In fact, research proves that happy music is associated with better economic performance, and lyrics can mirror cultural moods. So we decided to unravel the sentiments behind every song that outshone the others in their respective year, resonating deeply with the Recording Academy and winning itself the Grammy for the Song of the Year. 

For convenience, we simply used the Kaggle dataset of 1958-2019 all Grammy winners and nominees, updating it, and filtering for the recipients only. After extracting the lyrics from Google, we cleaned the lyrics for punctuations and stopwords like ‘ayy’ and ‘whoa’ till we had our bag of words ready. We then ran a quick sentiment analysis using the NLTK library of Python.
