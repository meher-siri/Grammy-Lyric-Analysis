Pienso que un sueño parecido no volverá más

And I painted my hands and face blue
Y me pintaba las manos y la cara de azul

And suddenly the fast wind took me
Y de improviso el viento rápido me llevó

And made me fly in the infinite sky
Y me hizo volar en el cielo infinito
I will fly, oh-oh
Volaré, oh-oh

I'll sing, oh-oh-oh-oh
Cantaré, oh-oh-oh-oh

In the blu dipinto di blu
Nel blu dipinto di blu

Happy to stare lassù
Felice di stare lassù
And flying, flying happy
Y volando, volando feliz

I feel taller
Yo me encuentro más alto

Higher than the sun
Más alto que el sol

And while in the world
Y mientras que en el mundo

He slowly walks away from me
Se aleja despacio de mí

sweet music
Una música dulce

It's been played just for me
Se ha tocado solo para mí
I will fly, oh-oh
Volaré, oh-oh

I'll sing, oh-oh-oh-oh

In the blu dipinto di blu
Nel blu dipinto di blu

Felice di stare lassù

Pienso que un sueño parecido no volverá más

And I painted my hands and face blue
Y me pintaba las manos y la cara de azul

Y de improviso el viento rápido me llevo

And made me go fly in the infinite sky
Y me hizo ir a volar en el cielo infinito
I will fly, oh-oh
Volaré, oh-oh

Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'
We took a little bacon, and we took a little beans
And we met the bloody British near the town of New Orleans

We fired our guns, and the British kept a-comin'
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more, and they began runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Well, I seed Mars Jackson a-walklin' down the street
And a-talkin' to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafitte
H? gave Jean a drink that he brung from T?nnessee
And the pirate said he'd help us drive the British in the sea

The French told Andrew, ""You'd better run
For Pakenham's a-comin' with a bullet in his gun""
Old Hickory said he didn't give a damn
He's a-gonna whip the britches off of Colonel Pakenham

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more, and they began runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well, we looked down the river, and we seed the British come
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high, and they made their bugles ring
While we stood beside our cotton bales, didn't say a thing


Old Hickory said we'd take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire a musket 'til we looked 'em in the eyes
We held our fire 'til we seed their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave 'em hell


We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more, and they began runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico


Well, they ran through the briars, and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico



Well, we fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So, we grabbed a alligator, and we fought another round
We filled his head with Minié balls and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind


They lost their pants and their pretty shiny coats
And their tails were all a-showin' like a bunch of billy goats
They run down the river with their tongues hangin' out
And they said they got a lickin' which there wasn't any doubt


We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more, and they began runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico


Well, we marched back to town in our dirty ragged pants
And we danced all night with them pretty girls from France
We couldn't understand 'em but they had the sweetest charms
And we understood 'em better when we got 'tm in our arms

The guide who brung the British from the sea
Came a-limpin' into camp just as sick as he could be
He said the dyin' words of the Colonel Pakenham
Was, ""You better quit you're foolin' with your cousin, Uncle Sam""

Fred our guns, and the British kept a-comin'
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more, and they began runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Well, we'll march back home but we'll never be content
'Til we make Old Hickory the people's president
And every time we think about the bacon and the beans
We'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans

We fired our guns, and the British kept a-comin'
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago

We fired once more, and they began runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Well, they ran through the briars, and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em

To mend its broken wing

And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song
The shadow of a smile
The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes
My love and see
All the lovely things
You are to me
Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips

Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile
For his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize
It never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
And nothing at all keeps sending him...

Somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere, she will return

I just never took the time
When you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused when you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed, I read it some place, I got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason, you do it for me

What's love, but a second-hand emotion?

Who?
I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh-oh-oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love, but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

No hungry mouths to feed

Soaring, tumbling, free wheeling

I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

She didn't believe in transcendence

There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care

Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away


You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you


It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day

Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end

I'm sick of it all
Can you hear me when I sing?
You're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in me

Still got to let you know
A house doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone

You think I should
I know you said
Why can't you just get over it?
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
I made my bed, and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets, and I don't mind saying
It's a sad, sad story
When a mother will teach her daughter
That she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world
Can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter
Saying that I better
Shut up and sing
Or my life will be over?

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own




I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand


I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

So let's set the world on fire

Just carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
Just carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
The moon is on my side (na na na na na na)
I have no reason to run (na na na na na na)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight (na na na na na na)
The angels never arrived (na na na na na na)

Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see

Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23

Maybe just the touch of a hand

And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'll just keep on making the same mistakes

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)

Starting a war, screaming, ""Peace"" at the same time
All the corruption, injustice, the same crimes
Always a problem if we do or don't fight
And we die, we don't have the same right
What is a gun to a man that surrenders?
What's it gonna take for someone to defend her?
If we all agree that we're equal as people
Then why can't we see what is evil?

I can't breathe

You're taking my life from me
I can't breathe
Will anyone fight for me? (Yeah)
Will anyone fight for me?
Trying times all the time
Destruction of minds, bodies, and human rights
Stripped of bloodlines, whipped and confined
This is the American pride
It's justifying a genocide
Romanticizing the theft and bloodshed
That made America the land of the free
To take a black life, land of the free
To bring a gun to a peaceful fight for civil rights
You are desensitized to pulling triggers on innocent lives
Because that's how we got here in the first place
These wounds sink deeper than the bullet
Your entitled hands could ever reach
Generations and generations of pain, fear, and anxiety
Equality is walking without intuition
Saying the protector and the killer is wearing the same uniform
The revolution is not televised
Media perception is forced down the throats of closed minds
So it's lies in the headlines
And generations of supremacy resulting in your ignorant, privileged eyes
We breathe the same and we bleed the same
But still, we don't see the same
Be thankful we are God-fearing
Because we do not seek revenge
We seek justice, we are past fear
We are fed up eating your shit
Because you think your so-called ""Black friend""
Validates your wokeness and erases your racism
That kind of uncomfortable conversation
Is too hard for your trust-fund pockets to swallow
To swallow the strange fruit hanging from my family tree
Because of your audacity
To say all men are created equal in the eyes of God
But disparage a man based on the color of his skin
Do not say you do not see color
When you see us, see us

2023,65thAnnual GRAMMY Awards  (2022),,,Song Of The Year,Just Like That,Bonnie Raitt,,"I watched him circle round the block
Finally stopped at mine
Took a while before he knocked
Like all he had was time
Excuse me, ma'am, maybe you can help
The directions weren't so clear
I'm looking for Olivia Zand
They said I might find her here
I looked real hard and asked him
What she's got he's looking for?
Said there's somethin' I think she'd want to know
And I let him in the door
It's not like me to trust so quick
Caught me by surprise
But somethin' about him gave me ease
Right there in his eyes
And just like that your life can change
If I hadn't looked away
My boy might still be with me now
He'd be 25 today
No knife can carve away the stain
No drink can drown regret
They say Jesus brings you peace and grace
Well he ain't found me yet
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
He sat down and took a deeper breath
Then looked right in my face
I heard about the son you lost
How you left without a trace
I've spent years just trying to find you
So I could finally let you know
It was your son's heart that saved me
And a life you gave us both
And just like that your life can change
Look what the angels send
I lay my head upon his chest
And I was with my boy again
I spent so long in darkness
Never thought the night would end
But somehow grace has found me
And I had to let him in
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
